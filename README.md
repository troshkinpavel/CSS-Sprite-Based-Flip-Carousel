# CSS-Sprite-Based-Flip-Carousel
 This project is a pure CSS-based dynamic interactive book that simulates page-flipping animations using cutting-edge features available in modern Chrome (134â€“135+). It seamlessly combines several powerful CSS technologies to create a fully scrollable, sprite-driven animated experience resembling a book with turning pages.
